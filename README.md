# Modelling and Simulation of a Biped Walking Robot

In this project, we implemented the static walking of biped robot in 2D and 3D. 

## Setup of 2D Model

Run 'TrajectoryGeneration_2D.m' to get the MATLAB path ready.
Open the 'BipedWalking_2D.slx' simulink model and run it.

## Setup of 3D Model

Run 'TrajectoryGeneration_3D.m' to get the MATLAB path ready.
Open the 'BipedWalking_3D.slx' simulink model and run it.

## Multiphysics and Contact Libraries
For convenience, local copies of the Simscape Multibody Multiphysics Library and
Simscape Multibody Contact Forces Library have been included with this submission.
